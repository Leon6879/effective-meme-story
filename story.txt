Lion's story

The little boy's name was Bob and he liked to eat pizza.
Bob's favorite kind of pizza was pepperoni on thin crust. He prides himself on
his ability to make a great pizza at home. By heating up his oven to as hot as
it goes, it cooks the thin crust to perfection in only a matter of minutes.
Bob loves to say "Mama Mia" while cooking.
