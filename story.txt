Lion's story

The little boy's name was Bob and he liked to eat pizza.
Bob's favorite kind of pizza was pepperoni on thin crust. He prides himself on
his ability to make a great pizza at home. By heating up his oven to as hot as
it goes, it cooks the thin crust to perfection in only a matter of minutes.
Bob loves to say "Mama Mia" while cooking.

Bob planned a party at his place so he could share his culinary skill with all of his friends.
The party was in four hours and Bob realized he forgot to buy pepperoni.
"Mama Mia" he yelled before rushing off to the nearest store.

He went back to the store and found two guys wearing black hoods.
Next morning, the police found him dead.
